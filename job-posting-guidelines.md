# Job Posting Guidelines

While job postings on the CSC Facebook page is allowed, we ask that both community members and prospective employers follow a few rules.

## Rules for Job Posters

**#1 Think before you post**

Job posters, please try and be informed before posting on the page. Your totally awesome startup idea that came to you in a dream last night could be the next big thing, but think before you post. If you need advice before looking for a developer, ask for advice first. Chances are those who provide good advice would also make good candidates for the position you're looking to fill.

**#2 Please explain your idea**

You do not need to explain the exact nature of the job in your posting (although if you do, you are **much** more likely to receive a response), but you must be willing to discuss the nature of work with a candidate over private message. If you are unwilling to disclose any information, you will likely not find any willing candidates and **your post will also be removed.**

**#3 Predatory job postings will be removed**

Admins are free to remove your job posting if they feel that it is predatory. While people are allowed to make their own decisions, in the best interest of our community memebers we will remove your post if we feel that it is taking advantage of students.

**#4 Only post once**

Repeat postings for the same position will be removed.

**#5 Comments are not the same as interest**

Just because someone comments on your posting, does not mean that they are interested.

### FAQ

**My job posting was removed, why?**

If your job posting was removed, you should receive a message from one of the admins with an explanation. If you do not, feel free to message on and ask.

## Rules for Community Members

### Do not troll bad job postings

**#1 Do not troll bad job postings**

**#2 DO NOT TROLL BAD JOB POSTINGS**

Job posters are not necessarily informed in all of the technical lingo and their postings may come off as ridiculous. Please, rather than making some snarky remark, please refer them to these posting guidelines and be constructive. Enquiring about a job posting is alright, but please try to be constructive. Comments saying "I agree with such and such" are not constructive. If you agree with a criticism, simply like the comment. **Non-constructive comments on job postings will be removed.**

### What do I do if I feel that a job posting is predatory?
If you think a job posting is predatory, please report the post as spam and message one of the admins with your reasoning. We will decide whether or not it should be removed.
